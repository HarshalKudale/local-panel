# Local Panel

**Local Panel is a desktop API development workspace for localhost routing, capture, mocking, protocol testing, and git-backed configuration.**

It brings together `*.localhost` mappings, proxy rules, capture tooling, REST/GraphQL/SOAP/gRPC request authoring, browser-assisted workflows, TLS interception, and workspace history in one developer-focused app.

## Main capabilities

- map friendly `*.localhost` domains to local services
- intercept, inspect, and replay HTTP traffic
- create mocks for REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and gRPC workflows
- save and organize authored requests across protocols
- use a browser companion extension for DevTools-driven capture and mock creation
- version workspace data with git and sync it between collaborators
